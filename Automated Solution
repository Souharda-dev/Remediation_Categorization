# Example: Database of solutions (we received a mapping file which we had stored in SQL DB)
solutions_db = {
    "OS Issue": "Restart your system and update drivers.",
    "Software Bug": "Reinstall the application or check for patches.",
    "Access Problem": "Reset password or contact IT admin."

# Predict and suggest solution

    reshaped = vectorized.reshape(1, 1, vectorized.shape[1])
    prediction = model.predict(reshaped)
    predicted_label = label_encoder.inverse_transform([prediction.argmax()])[0]
    return solutions_db.get(predicted_label, "Contact support for further assistance.")

# Example Usage
ticket = "My Windows keeps freezing"
print(predict_and_resolve(ticket))  # Output: "Restart your system and update drivers."
