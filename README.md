Automated Help Desk Solution with AI
An LSTM-Based System for Instant IT Ticket Resolution

Project Overview
This project automates IT help desk operations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (LSTM neural networks) to instantly classify support tickets and provide solutions. It reduces manual workload, speeds up response times, and improves efficiency for large-scale tech support teams.

Key Features
Automatic Ticket Classification: Uses AI to categorize tickets (e.g., "OS Issue," "Network Problem").

Instant Solution Suggestions: Retrieves predefined fixes based on predicted categories.

Scalable API: Can be integrated into existing help desk systems via a REST API.

High Accuracy: Achieves over 90% accuracy in classifying support tickets.

How It Works
Text Preprocessing:

Cleans and normalizes ticket text (removes stopwords, punctuation, and applies lemmatization).

Converts text into numerical data using TF-IDF vectorization.

Deep Learning Model (LSTM):

A neural network trained to understand and classify ticket descriptions.

Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to capture context in text.

Automated Resolution:

Predicts the ticket category and fetches a predefined solution from a knowledge base.

Can be deployed as a Flask API for real-time predictions.
